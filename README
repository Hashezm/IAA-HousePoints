## Project Overview
The Housepoints project was developed by a team of four students to create a relational database and a web application that allows administrators to manage individual student house points and the points for each house. The application also enables users to search the points of each house and student, and view leaderboards specialized to the learning profiles of the International Baccalaureate (IB) system.

## Key Features
1. **Admin Management**: Admins can manage house points for individual students and houses.
2. **User Search**: Users can search for points by house and student.
3. **Leaderboards**: View leaderboards specialized to the IB learning profiles.

- **Database**: MySQL (managed with phpMyAdmin)
- **Server**: XAMPP for local development
