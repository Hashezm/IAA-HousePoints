## Project Overview
The Housepoints project was developed by a team of four students to create a relational database and a web application that allows administrators to manage individual student house points and the points for each house. The application also enables users to search the points of each house and student, and view leaderboards specialized to the learning profiles of the International Baccalaureate (IB) system.

## Key Features
1. **Admin Management**: Admins can manage house points for individual students and houses.
2. **User Search**: Users can search for points by house and student.
3. **Leaderboards**: View leaderboards specialized to the IB learning profiles.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL (managed with phpMyAdmin)
- **Server**: XAMPP for local development

## Installation Instructions
1. **Download and Install XAMPP**:
   - Go to the [XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the XAMPP installer for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions on the website.

2. **Download the Project**:
   - Download the ZIP file of this project from the [GitHub repository](URL_TO_GITHUB_REPO).
   - Extract the ZIP file to the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation. Typically, this is located at `C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows or `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` on macOS.

3. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Open phpMyAdmin by navigating to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your web browser.
   - Create a new database for the project.
   - Import the provided SQL file into this database to set up the necessary tables and data. The SQL file is located in the project directory.

4. **Run the Project**:
